### **Chapter 1**



#### Pitch

Can adjust idea to better fit.

Primary elements need to be considered.



#### Project aims and objectives

System dependency.

System cascading failures.

Simulating space combat.

Accurate flight in space. (thrusters with rotational torque)

! Using in game objects to handle game systems. (DIS core)



#### SMART principle

Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relatable, and Time-specific.



#### Project feasibility analysis

Prove that I am able to create this project. (EGO /jk)

Use exsiting games such as space engineers, reverse engineer and show them with rough diagrams that YOU can make this system and YOU know what you are doing.



Can we prove this is feasible, resources, time etc.







### **Chapter 2**



#### Design Criterion

The documentation aka GDD and TDD. We very much need the TDD designed in full.



##### GDD

Assess the clarity of the GDD and TDD.

Game Design documentation can of course be a collection of the following:



a. Game Design Doc



b. Level Design Doc



c. Game Wireframes (Menus, HUD)



d. Puzzle Designs



e. Monster Designs (AI)



f. Character Designs



g. Story Transcript / Dialogue





*On the other hand, product design documents can essentially include the following:*



*a. Low-Fidelity and High-Fidelity Wireframes*



*b. Minimal Interactivity Digital Prototypes*



*c. Sketches*



*d. List of Features and commands including step-by-step methodology*





##### TDD

UML Class Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, State Diagrams. Pseudocode and general flowcharts are allowed.



SHOW the UML diagrams will be of use.



You can make changes and version the diagrams for any major amendments.



TDD is worth more for programmers...?





### **Chapter 3**



#### WBS (Scope)

* Does it follow all the WBS rules? (Hierarchy, Numbering, Mutual-Exclusivity, etc?)
* Are all your work packages appropriately named?
* Are all your work packages estimated?
* The degree of organization in the report as well as the quality of the visual you give us.
* Do your estimations take into account the hours you’ll exclusively spend in production?
* Your justification on your scope and estimations (and the technique you used for them).





#### Define your Risk Management Strategy

Traditionally the document that has won the prize of “most never-used-yet-completed document” by students for the purpose of grading. However we want to emphasize how important this doc can be if anything goes wrong. If anything at all goes wrong during production and post-production you will be asked to review your risk management plan and act accordingly. If any risk occurs that you have predicted and you don’t react according to plan you’ll see this score plummet.



You will be evaluated on the following:



* Have you identified adequate risks for your project?
* Do all risks have a potential trigger, a probability, and a clear impact?
* Do all your risks have a recovery and contingency?
* Do you have an Impact/Probability matrix?
* Do you have risks UNIQUE to your project that can’t be applied to any FMP ever?
* Have you given a justification for your top 10 risks?
* Have you prepared your Risk-Impact Matrix?





#### Your Tracking Plan

Finally, this sub-criterion is all about how you are tracking your project. Which tools are you using to track progress? And which tools for source control? You are required to have both for your project. And basically write us how you will be using them. We want to know your process.





#### Gantt Chart

Compress your WBS into a Gantt Chart covering the major phases and key tasks in those phases showing their dependencies to other tasks.
